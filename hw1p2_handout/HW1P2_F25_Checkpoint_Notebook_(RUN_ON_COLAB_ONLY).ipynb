However, looking at the training loss and validation accuracy curves as the training progresses, David is surprised to find out that although his training accuracy decreased, his validation accuracy also decreased. Finally, at the end of training the same 10 epochs, the model's validation accuracy is indeed worse. David concludes that dropout is not effective and tries something else.\n",
        "- **B**: Looking at the writeup, David notices that one of the things to try is larger model size. To improve his model, David tries adding 2 more layers his model and finds that the accuracy had increased a great deal! Confident that his change had been beneficial, David continues building on the updated model, trying other changes.\n",
        "- **C**: David knows from talking with TAs and referencing the writeup that adding context and adding some dropout are good ways that he can improve his model. Reasoning along this line, he tried increasing context and added a little bit of dropout between the layers to reduce overfitting.\n",
        "- **D**: David first chooses to experiment with increasing context size, as suggested in the writeup. He tries increasing the context size to 6 and notices a remarkable boost in performance. He then goes on to test increasing model sizes, adding batchnorm, etc."
